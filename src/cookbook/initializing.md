# Initializing a build environment #

The "Getting Started" section describes how to set up your local work
environment. You will need to use Linux to build the OpenChange source files.

# Dependencies #

Installing OpenChange and Samba4 from sources requires several
dependencies. You may already have installed some (or all of them) as
part of previous development. However this guide has been written
using fresh installed and minimal Linux
distributions. Installing the list of packages described below ensures
your environment is compliant with OpenChange requirements.

## Ubuntu ##

<br/>
The instructions have been updated and tested with `12.04.1 LTS`.
<br/>

### Compilation tools ###

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake ccache pkg-config python python-dev libacl1-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install git flex bison docbook-xsl xsltproc

### OpenChange dependencies ###

    $ sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev libical-dev libmagic-dev libboost-thread-dev zlib1g-dev libmysqlclient-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev mysql-server python-mysqldb libevent-dev libparse-pidl-perl
    $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libpcap0.8 libpcap0.8-dev

### OpenChange documentation and testing tools (Optional) ###

    $ sudo apt-get install doxygen
    $ sudo apt-get install libsubunit-dev libcppunit-dev check gawk

## Fedora ##

<br/>

### Compilation Tools ###

    # yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Legacy Software Development" 
    # yum install ccache python-devel git-all docbook-style-xsl perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker libacl-devel

### OpenChange dependencies ###

    # yum install popt-devel libical-devel sqlite-devel file-devel boost-thread

### Set environment variable to make boost-thread work ###

    export BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX="-mt" 

**Note**: You may wish to set the `BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX` environment
  variable in your startup scripts (e.g. `~/.bashrc`) instead of
  hand-adding it each time you want to build.

# Setting up a Linux build environment #

OpenChange installs OpenChange and Samba4 binaries and libraries in
non-standard locations, mostly to avoid any potential conflicts with
Samba3 installation which may come by default with the system. While
this is not a requirement for current install, we will anyway set this
up. This requires telling the system and dynamic linker about these
location:

    # Teach ld.so about the non standard location of samba4 libraries
    $ echo '/usr/local/samba/lib' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/samba4.conf
    # update PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PYTHONPATH
    $ echo 'PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/samba/lib/pkgconfig; export PKG_CONFIG_PATH' | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/samba4-env-build.sh
    $ echo 'PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/samba/lib/python2.7/site-packages;export PYTHONPATH' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/samba4-env-build.sh
    $ . /etc/profile.d/samba4-env-build.sh

# Setting up OpenChange dependencies #

You will need Nanomsg and Libmemcached to compile Openchange.

    $ wget http://download.nanomsg.org/nanomsg-0.5-beta.tar.gz https://launchpadlibrarian.net/165454254/libmemcached-1.0.18.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvf nanomsg-0.5-beta.tar.gz libmemcached-1.0.18.tar.gz
    $ cd nanomsg-0.5-beta
    $ ./configure
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd ../memcached-1.0.18
    $ ./configure
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
    $ cd ..
